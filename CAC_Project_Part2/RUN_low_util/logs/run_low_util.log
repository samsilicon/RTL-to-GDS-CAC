Extraction called for design 'collision_avoidance_car' of instances=733 and nets=842 using extraction engine 'preRoute' .
PreRoute RC Extraction called for design collision_avoidance_car.
RC Extraction called in multi-corner(1) mode.
**WARN: (IMPEXT-6197):	The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using preRoute extraction or postRoute extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap table file using the 'generateCapTbl' command and specify it before extraction using 'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.
